   To gather playtime data, we have heterogeneous data sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaming Platform: Platforms like Steam, PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, and Nintendo eShop provide playtime data for games.</li>
<li>Database Website: Websites like HowLongToBeat and Kaggle provide some basic playtime data of numerous popular games for free, which is a extremely suitable data source for us.</li>
<li>Social Media and Forums: Platforms like Reddit, gaming forums, and social media channels often have discussions and posts where users share their playtime experiences.<br>
   The following is the story of using the data source.<br>
   The game publisher has launched a new video game on a specific platform, offering players the opportunity to purchase and download the game directly from the platform. This seamless integration allows players to not only engage with the game but also provide valuable feedback through comments and reviews. Additionally, the game’s system meticulously records the average time players spend on each mode, offering a comprehensive insight into player preferences and behaviors, often referred to as “feedback.”<br>
  Analyzing player comments serves as a fundamental aspect of understanding overall player sentiment and specific gameplay experiences. These comments offer a wealth of information for the development team, ranging from identifying gameplay challenges to technical errors or areas where player experience falls short. This feedback serves as a cornerstone for formulating improvement strategies for subsequent versions of the game.<br>
  Furthermore, tracking the average time players spend on each mode proves to be a crucial dataset. This data aids the development team in discerning which modes are favored by players and which may require adjustments or enhancements. By scrutinizing player gameplay durations, developers gain a deeper understanding of player interests and preferences, enabling them to tailor game content and mechanics to enhance the overall gaming experience.<br>
  Moreover, player feedback provides essential guidance for the future direction of the game. Through meticulous examination of player comments and gameplay time data, development teams can determine which features, modes, or content should take precedence in future updates or expansions. This ensures that the game continues to captivate players and remains aligned with market demands.<br>
  In summary, recording player comments and gameplay time proves to be a vital component of the game development process. This feedback not only aids in improving the current version of the game but also provides invaluable experience and guidance for future game development endeavors, ultimately leading to the creation of superior gaming experiences.<br>
